## Description

Welcome to **Hatman**, a spine-chilling horror game where you take on the role of a doctor investigating the mind-altering effects of a potent psychoactive drug. The hospital, once a beacon of modern medicine, has transformed into a terrifying maze. An enigmatic force, born from the drug's dark power, shadows your every move within the facility's walls.

In this game, your mental and physical prowess will be put to the test through intricate puzzles and life-or-death decisions. While running may seem like a viable option, stealth is often the wiser pathâ€”any sound could betray your presence to the relentless predator that haunts the hospital's otherwise sterile halls.
